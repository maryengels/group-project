    New York City Ballet is a ballet company founded in 1948 by choreographer George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein. Léon Barzin was the company's first music director. Balanchine and Jerome Robbins are considered the founding choreographers of the company. In a 1946 letter, Kirstein stated, "The only justification I have is to enable Balanchine to do exactly what he wants to do in the way he wants to do it." He served as the company's General Director from 1946 to 1989, developing and sustaining it by his organizational and fundraising abilities.

      <strong>CENTRAL PARK</strong>
   </h2-m>
   <p class="paragraph2-m"> 
   Central Park is an Urban oasis centered between the East and West side of Manhattan. The park was established in 1857 on 778 acres of land acquired by the city. In 1858, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and architect/landscape designer Calvert Vaux won a design competition to improve and expand the park with a plan they titled the "Greensward Plan". Construction began the same year, and the park's first area was opened to the public in the winter of 1858. Construction north of the park continued during the American Civil War in the 1860s, and the park was expanded to its current size in 1873. After a periods of decline in the early 20th century, Robert Moses started a program to clean up Central Park. Another decline in the late 20th century spurred the creation of the Central Park Conservancy in 1980, which refurbished many parts of the park during the 1980s and 1990s.

    Rising from Bethesda Terrace is Bethesda Fountain, with the famous Angel of the Waters statue atop. The fountain commemorates the Croton water system, which first brought fresh water to New York City in 1842. The angel carries a lily in her left hand — a symbol of the water's purity. Created by Emma Stebbins, it also marked the first time a woman received a public art commission in New York City.

    At Loeb Boathouse, visitors can rent rowboats or dine overlooking views of the Lake. Boating on the Lake has been a popular pastime from the Park's earliest days. As interest in rowing grew, the Lake needed a proper boathouse. In 1874, Park architect Calvert Vaux designed a rustic building on the eastern shoreline. With its charming Victorian touches, the building also featured a second-story terrace that afforded beautiful views of the Ramble.

 The Boathouse is popular with families and children because of the famous climbing sculptures nearby, the model boats and the cafe. An ornamental pond was constructed as a reflecting pool for a glass conservatory, but when the plan for a structure was abandoned, the water body became the popular model boat pond, inspired by those in Parisian parks.
